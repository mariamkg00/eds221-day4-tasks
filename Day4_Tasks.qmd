Create two sequences, one called `weekdays` that contains days of the week (\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", etc.) and one called `transects` that contains the series of transect names \"Transect A\", \"Transect B,\"Transect C\". Write a nested for loop that creates a matrix containing the following:

```{r}
weekdays <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday")
transects <- c("Transect A","Transect B","Transect C")


weekday_transects <- matrix(nrow= length(weekdays), ncol= length(transects))
```

```{r}
for (i in seq_along(weekdays)) {
  for (j in seq_along(transects)) {
  weekday_transects[i,j]= print(paste(weekdays[i],"-",transects[j]))
  }
}
```

```{r}

```
